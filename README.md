Question:01
Create a simple Car class that includes attributes like name, model, and year.
Create two derived classes, ElectricCar and GasCar, which inherit from the Car class.
Consider adding a battery capacity attribute to the ElectricCar class and a fuel efficiency
characteristic to the GasCar class.The user will enter the battery capacity and fuel efficiency
attribute values based on the type of vehicle. For electric cars, the input should be battery
capacity, while for gas cars, the input should be fuel efficiency.
Sample Input:
Enter car type (Electric/Gas):Electric
Enter Name: Tesla
Enter model: Model S
Enter year: 2022
Enter battery capacity (kWh): 100
Enter car type (Electric/Gas): Gas
Enter Name: Toyota
Enter model: Camry
Enter year: 2022
Enter fuel efficiency (MPG): 30
Sample Output:
Car Information:
2022 Tesla Model S
Battery Capacity: 100 kWh
Car Information:
2022 Toyota Camry
Fuel Efficiency: 30 MPG

Question:02
Objective:
Create a basic Car Inventory System where users may enter new car info. The system
should allow users to add both electric and gas cars by using the Car, ElectricCar, and
GasCar classes.
Users will enter car information dynamically, which will be kept in a database.
[Note: You must implement the previously mentioned OOP solution in your system.]
Requirements:
1. Create an example add-form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Create a database that stores car-related information.
You can use any database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, MongoDB).
3. After submitting the form, store the data in the database using any preferred language.
(php, python, c#, java)
4. Show the list of car data using any datatable.
(Bootstrap Datatable, Jquery Datatable, yajra datatables)
